## What is Sql?

Sql is a Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language designed to manage and retrieve information from relational database management systems. One of its main features is the use of algebra and relational calculus to perform queries in order to easily retrieve information from databases, as well as make changes to them.

## Introduction

Originally based on relational algebra and relational calculus, Sql consists of a data definition language, a data manipulation language, and a data control language. The scope of Sql includes data insertion, queries, updates and deletions, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Additionally, Sql is sometimes described as a declarative language and also includes procedural elements.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial goal of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for now it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
