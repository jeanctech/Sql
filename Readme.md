## Introduction

Originally based on relational algebra and relational calculus, Sql consists of a data definition language, a data manipulation language, and a data control language. The scope of Sql includes data insertion, queries, updates and deletions, schema creation and modification, and data access control. Also Sql is sometimes described as a declarative language, it also includes procedural elements

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
