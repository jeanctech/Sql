relational database management tools, such as MySql and PostgreSql. */

/* Sql continues to be a fundamental part of data management in a variety of applications and systems.
In addition to traditional Rdbms systems, Sql is used in NoSql and NewSql systems. */

/* Sql has become an essential language for managing and querying databases in a wide range of applications.
range of applications, from websites to business and scientific systems. The standardization of Sql has
contributed to its longevity and versatility, and remains a fundamental tool in the world of information
