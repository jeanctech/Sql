/* Sql History */

The history of Sql (Structured Query Language) dates back to the 1960s and 1970s. Sql
It was developed as a result of the efforts of IBM, particularly its researcher Edgar F. Codd,
who published a paper in 1970 titled "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." In
In this article, Codd introduced the concept of a relational data model and proposed a language for
access and manipulate data in relational databases. Codd's work laid the foundation for what
later it would become Sql.

Over the years, Sql has evolved and become a widely accepted standard for
relational database management. Here are some important milestones in the history of Sql.

1. **1970s**: IBM developed the first system based on the relational data model, called
System R. They also presented SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), a language that laid the foundation
for Sql. The name SEQUEL later became Sql due to trademark issues.

2. **1980s**: Several companies developed relational database management systems
(RDBMS) based on SQL, such as Oracle, Ingres and Sybase. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
started to standardize Sql in this decade.

3. **1990s**: Sql became an ANSI standard and later an ISO standard.
Relational databases and SQL became widely popular in business and IT applications.
software.

4. **2000s**: With the rise of the web and the need for online databases, systems emerged
more web-oriented relational database management tools, such as MySql and PostgreSql.

5. **2010s and beyond**: SQL continues to be a fundamental part of data management in a
variety of applications and systems. In addition to traditional Rdbms systems, Sql is used in
NoSql and NewSql systems.

SQL has become an essential language for managing and querying databases in a wide range of applications.
range of applications, from websites to business and scientific systems. The standardization of
Sql has contributed to its longevity and versatility, and remains a fundamental tool in the world
of information technology.
